# VRTRAKILL
ULTRAKILLing in VR is now a thing.  
##### Scroll all the way down to see requirements & installing process.

## Features
Actually ULTRAKILLing in VR!!!

### Adapted immersive weapons and HUD for VR
Using special nano technology I've adapted weapons present at the moment (P-2 Update) so you get the best ULTRAKILLing experience:
- Who the fuck reads private READMEs? Who the fuck does have access to them? Whatever i haven't done shit lol.
- At this moment i stopped redacting README.md
- Future me, please, fill this out like a normal person would do, thanks

### VR Weapon Wheelie thing!!
Since you cannot use keyboard with VR (if you do you're a weirdo) I've made a **COOL WEAPON WHEELIE THING!!!**
##### Might come out as a standalone mod for original ULTRAKILL.

## Requirements
- A (preferably) working VR compatible PC
- One of the supported devices
### Supported devices:
- Oculus Quest (1 + 2)  
- More devices will get added when somebody sends me their valve index / htc vive / win mixed reality etc.  
Feel free to pull request your code for those devices though (sending me your headset is a better option)

## Installing VRTRAKILL
1. Copy your ULTRAKILL to a new folder and rename it however you like (also a cool practice to separate original from vr one)
2. Get & Install [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21)(latest atm is 5.4.21) using their guide
3. Paste Release DLLs in BepInEx\plugins folder
4. Steam shenanigans:

  4.2 Properties -> Shortcut -> Include in VR Library
5. Open SteamVR
6. Select your VR-ed ULTRAKILL
7. Run it
