# 0.12 Movement is BACK!

Do you play VRtrakill and think to yourself "Man, this rocket launcher sucks ass," and, "Dashes and Slides suck as well?"
Do I have the Thing for you! 
This is an edit of VRtrakill's dll that fixes the rocket launcher and "fixes" the dashes and slides.


# Steps
- Download Whateverusername0's VRtrakill at it's [latest release](https://github.com/whateverusername0/VRTRAKILL/releases) and follow the steps there (You can do it I believe in you)
- Download the latest release of this github (It's this one right here. The releases tab should be over here ---->)
- Replace the .dll file with the one from here
- YIPPEE


# Funky Stuff
Slides and Dashes will only give full speed when not inputting a direction. If a direction is being held, Slides will not go very fast, and Dashes will not go very far.
However, this makes 0-4's challenge quite easy.
