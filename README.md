# VRTRAKILL
ULTRAKILLing in VR is now a thing.  
This mod exists because [HuskVR](https://github.com/TeamDoodz/HuskVR) is not being updated for like 7 months, so I was like "Fine, I'll do it myself"  

##### MOST OF THE FEATURES BELOW ARE WIP, I DID NOT DO EVERYTHING PROMISED IN THE README.MD, WAIT FOR THEM TO COME OUT

##### Scroll all the way down to see requirements & installing process.

## Features

### Full-sized VR support
- WIP LOL, only camera works atm (not without crutches)

### VR Weapon Wheelie thing!!
Since you cannot use keyboard with VR (if you do you're a weirdo) I've made a **COOL WEAPON WHEELIE THING!!!**
- WIP LOL

## Requirements
- A (preferably) working VR compatible PC  
- A PCVR headset w/ SteamVR installed
### Tested headsets:
- Oculus Quest + ALVR  
- I don't have all the headsets to test them out and add here

1. Begin doing ULTRAKILL shenanigans:  
  1.1 Locate ULTRAKILL in your Steam library (or wherever you store it)  
  1.2 RMB -> Manage -> Browse local files  
  1.3 Copy your ULTRAKILL to a new whatever folder and rename it however you like (also a cool practice to separate original from vr one)  
2. Get & Install [latest stable at the momemt BepInEx 5.4.21](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) using their guide, make sure to run BepInEx'ed ULTRAKILL atleast once so it can generate needed folders & files  
3. Download one of the releases and merge both folders
4. Begin doing Steam shenanigans:  
  4.1 ADD A GAME (at the bottom left in library) -> Add a non-steam game -> select your VR-ed ULTRAKILL.exe  
  4.2 Properties -> Shortcut -> Include in VR Library
5. Open SteamVR
6. Select your VR-ed ULTRAKILL
7. Run it
