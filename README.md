ULTRAKILLing in VR is now a thing.  
This mod exists because [HuskVR](https://github.com/TeamDoodz/HuskVR) is not being updated for like 7 months, so I was like "Fine, I'll do it myself"  

##### MOST OF THE FEATURES BELOW ARE WIP, I DID NOT DO EVERYTHING PROMISED IN THE README.MD, WAIT FOR THEM TO COME OUT

##### Scroll all the way down to see requirements & installing process.

## Features
### README is almost always outdated, better check releases for features
### Full-sized VR support
WIP LOL. For now you can only interact with objects by looking at the mwith your camera. Full controller support WIP

### VR Weapon Wheelie thing!!
Since you cannot use keyboard to swap weapons with VR (if you do you're a weirdo) I made a **COOL WEAPON WHEELIE THING!!!**  
(Waiting for PITR to release new weapon wheel, too lazy to do it now lol) For now you can bind weapon scroll to joysticks.

## Requirements
- A copy of ULTRAKILL (any kind)
- A (preferably) working VR compatible PC  
- A PCVR headset w/ SteamVR installed
### Tested 100% working headsets:
- Oculus Quest (+ ALVR)  
- HTC Vive (unsure. somebody else was trying it)  
- It should support all headsets that SteamVR supports, oh well.

## Installing VRTRAKILL in less than 11 steps
1. Begin doing ULTRAKILL shenanigans:  
  1.1 Locate ULTRAKILL in your Steam library (or wherever you store it)  
  1.2 RMB -> Manage -> Browse local files  
  1.3 Copy your ULTRAKILL to a new whatever folder and rename it however you like (also a cool practice to separate original from vr one)  
2. Get & Install [latest stable at the momemt BepInEx 5.4.21](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) using their guide, make sure to run BepInEx'ed ULTRAKILL atleast once so it can generate needed folders & files  
3. Download one of the releases and merge both folders
4. Begin doing Steam scrindonguloges:  
  4.1 ADD A GAME (at the bottom left in library) -> Add a non-steam game -> select your VR-ed ULTRAKILL.exe  
  4.2 Properties -> Shortcut -> Include in VR Library
5. Open SteamVR
6. Select your VR-ed ULTRAKILL
7. Run it once and exit (for now)  
8. Go to BepInEx/plugins/VRTRAKILL and edit VRTRAKILL_Config.json  
9. Run VR-ed ULTRAKILL again  
10. Begin ULTRAKILLing in VR
